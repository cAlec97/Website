<strong>
  Digital Arts Is Just like anyother painting, drawings and sketching
  and also what you see in galleries and including museums. What artist have very
  differnt creativity and also would be using so many different tools have so many
  smart ways to use their tools and also the techniques they also pick and choose
  whatever that will make their beautiful creative digital arts there is also
  other thing they like to piant with (oil, Watercolors or even pixcels). However,
  with what type of technology that has to been deals with digital painting and pixeling
  what an mastery over with other tools and such. with [Software, equipment,etc] what these
  types of software and programming that you can you use with digital arts and other type
  what mostly evey artist is about three basic categories.

  Other then that so many or several subcategories and also of course, and the
  great part that some digital artist will combine all these types of art into
  one which way digital art looks soo beauiful so amazing. And including so
  creative make something so great, with just using technology it is so crazy
  how what technologies these days can do for anyone in this world. How some like
  tablet can make something just by drawing or sketching, painting on a canvas
  its the samething but differnt in someway of what digital Art make me be so
  interested me into how prefect they can make something on screen.
  Turning it into something so amazing and beauiful like some artist can and
  few techquies they do to make it look they want to make it look. Photograpgy
  digitaling what the artist uses or may conventional camras. what the Photographs
  will be translated to a computer environment when the artist takes images and then
  edits also does a few other things like special effects software to it make its
  platform in a darkroom type of manipulation Digital collage with this type of
  software is a combines of any kind of image from sources that varying in one
  i guess you can say that and differnt techniques to an unqiue of the results.
  what the digital type of environment is to be less of restricted and also a
  medium intergration maniplation.
