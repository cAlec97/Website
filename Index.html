  <h1>What Is Digital Art?</h1>

<p><strong> With digital art it is just anyother type of art you see in the galleries and museums anything in that kind of arts.
but with this is just uses differnt tools is to be creative with it
What an artist picks and chooses whatever that speaks to him/her (oils, watercolors or even pixels)
with what technology has with art and what mastery over such tools [software, Equipment,etc]. However,what technology does for types of digital artsi believe their is about three basic categories

-Digital Painting
-Digital Photograpgy
-Freactals/ Algorithmic
-Digital Collage
-Intergrated Digital art
-Photopainting
-Vetor Drawing

Other then that so many or several subcategories and also of course, and the great part that some digital artist will combine all these types of art into one which way digital art looks soo beauiful
so amazing and including so creative make something so great, with just using technology it is so crazy how what technologies these days can do for anyone in this world how some like tablet can make
something just by drawing or sketching, painting on a canvas its the samething but differnt in someway of what digital Art make me be so interested me into how prefect they can make something on screen
turning it into something so amazing and beauiful like some artist can and few techquies they do to make it look they want to make it look. Photograpgy digitaling what the artist uses or may conventional
camras. what the Photographs will be translated to a computer environment when the artist takes images and then edits also does a few other things like special effects software to it make its platform in a darkroom type of manipulation
Digital collage with this type of software is a combines of any kind of image from sources that varying in one i guess you can say that and differnt techniques to an unqiue of the results. what the digital type of environment is to be less of restricted and also a medium intergration maniplation  </strong> </p>
